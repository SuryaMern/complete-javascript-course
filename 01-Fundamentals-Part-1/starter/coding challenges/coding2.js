/* Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement  */

//Example 1
/* let marksKg = 78
let marksHt = 1.69
let johnKg = 92
let johnHt = 1.95

let markMass = marksKg / marksHt ** 2
console.log(`Mark's BMI ${markMass}`);

let johnMass = johnKg/johnHt ** 2
console.log(`John's BMI ${johnMass}`);

if(markMass>johnMass){
    console.log("Mark's BMI is higher than John's!");
}
else{
    console.log("John's BMI is higher than Mark's!");
} */

//Example 2
/* let markKg = 95
